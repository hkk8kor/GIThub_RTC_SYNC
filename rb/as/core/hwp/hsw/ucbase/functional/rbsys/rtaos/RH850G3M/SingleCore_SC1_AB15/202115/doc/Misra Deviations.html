The MISRA deviations reported in the MISRA Deviations report are not considered to pose a risk to development as each deviation has been reviewed and subjected to suitable testing.
This means that RTA-OS library code featuring MISRA deviations does not require any mitigation actions to reduce development risk.
However user code which makes use of macros or RTA-OS API calls described in the RTA-OS header files Os.h should perform additional MISRA checking to assure the code is used correctly.
The locations in the MISRA Deviations report that result in code in Os.h are: Os_Safe_Cfg.h, OsMinusConfig.h, OsTrace.h, OsTargetTypes.h and Os_Cfg.h.
User code that includes target-specific header files such as Os_ConfigInterrupts.h or Os_DisableInterrupts.h that manipulate interrupt hardware should also be checked.
